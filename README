This is for learning purposes.

I am trying to understand how routers like gorilla/mux, julienschmidt/httprouter etc., work behind the scenes.
This is, of course, a very simple example, but I learned a bit about the main idea behind routers.

Request --> Router
                Decide which handler to run.
                If the request path is not known, reply with 404.
                Else, run the appropriate handler function.
